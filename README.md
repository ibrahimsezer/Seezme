## Getting Started with Provider

Seezme uses the [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package for state management. Provider simplifies managing state across the application and provides a clear separation of concerns between the UI and business logic. This approach allows for scalability and easier maintenance.

### Key Concepts with Provider

- **Providers**: Manage app-wide states, such as user authentication, message list updates, and chat room management.
- **Consumers**: Widgets that reactively update based on changes in the state, ensuring efficient UI rendering and a smooth user experience.
